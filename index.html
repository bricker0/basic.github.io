<h1>Britta Ricker, PhD</h1>

<p>As of April of 2018, I will be an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.itc.nl/">Faculty of Geoscience and Earth Observation (ITC)</a> at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

<h2>PROFESSIONAL AIM</h2>
<p>Through my research, I aim to illuminate techniques to make tools associated with Geographic Information Science (GIScience) more accessible to diverse audiences. With the proliferation and increased accessibility of spatial technologies comes seemingly endless opportunities to collect and share spatial data contributing to big data. As a GIScience researcher, I seek to identify new ways in which to visualize and understand these big data in an interactive fashion. I strive to investigate and test accessible methods of capturing and visualizing spatial data interactively. I view teaching as an opportunity to invite more and diverse perspectives to address these challenges and assist in the process of revealing patterns in spatial data. The ultimate aim of my research is to inform decision making regarding disaster management, environmental resources and social services.

<h2>TEACHING</h2><p>
I have taught a wide variety of classes at both the Masters and Undergraduate level including Introduction to Geospatial Technologies, Remote Sensing, Web Cartography, Web GIS, Mobile GIS and Environmental Planning Applications, and Introduction to Urban Research Methods University of Washington Tacoma, Simon Fraser University, and South Dakota State University.
