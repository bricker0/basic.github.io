<h2>Lab 5: GeoFence!</h2>
<p>In this lab we will be learning to build a native iOS application that will give you the ability to create a personalized geofense for yourself. Have you ever been to a place and you think to yourself "I want to come back here and order this same muffin!" or, "When I get close to Compass Rose, I need to remember to pick up a cute card for my Mom." With this app, you will be able to set reminders for yourself base on your location! 
Your end product will have two views. One showing all of your location based reminders which we will call geoshouts in this lab. The other view will be the interface to slect the location and range of each geoshout.</p>

<code>	class GeotificationsViewController: UIViewController, AddGeotificationsViewControllerDelegate, MKMapViewDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegate // Add this protocol {
 
  @IBOutlet weak var mapView: MKMapView!
 
  var geotifications = [Geotification]()
  let locationManager = CLLocationManager() // Add this statement </code>
